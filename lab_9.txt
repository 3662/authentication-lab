Question 3:
Session Authentication is appropriate for AJAX clients that run in the same 
session context as the website. Token Authentication is appropriate for 
client-server set ups.

Basic Authentication is not secure since it passes the user ID and password over 
the network as Base64 encoded that can be reversible. Token Authentication does
not do this.

Question 4:
Used in case a third party application requires access to an HTTP service on behalf of 
a user. The user visits a third party app and clicks an option to log in to 
an external account such as google. The user is then redirected to a Google app
where they enter their credentials. Once logged in, the user is redirected back
to the third party app and this third party app now has limited access to the 
user's data they need (such as their contact list).
